# WIP - Wordpress Rename Media

PHP script that search for media files with special characters, rename them, update the DB and create an 301 redirection to avoid to lose your SEO.

I'm developing this PHP script for a client to automatically rename years of special characters in the filename

I will try to make it generic but let me know if it doesn't work for you.

Warning: This project is in progress!
